Project Title
AI utilizing Standard Business Practices when reviewing Vendors' Statement of Work  - Final project for the Building AI course

##Summary
Creating an AI program that will review completed Statement of Work documents for digital providers.

Background
The time it takes to review digital companies' Statement of Work documents and compare the documentation to complexity of work and estimated costing, based on Standard Business Practices, is time consuming and inefficent.

Which problems does your idea solve? 
By having an AI solution that has the ability to compare mulitple Statement of Work documents to the Standards of Business Practice, identify the areas in the document that do not/do meet the standards and do not/do align with best practice industry standards and create a review document for the final approvers of the projects.
By utilizing the machine learning ability of AI to build over time, common themes, discrepancies and misalignment to the Standards of Business Practice in order to more efficiently and expediently, the productivity of our department will increase.

Data sources and AI methods
This AI solution will depend on the defined best practice Standards of Business Practices that procurement companies utilize. The Standards of Business Practice define what a Statement of Work's scope, deliverables and costing of projects should be based on. Within this Standard of Business Practice, it maps the types of project team members that will need to be utilized for various types of project work, the standard costing formula for how many hours should be required for each of the subject matter expert team members and compare the overall estimated costing for reasonable costing based on the complexity and type of project. The AI method compare the companies' Statement of Work document against the Standards of Business Practice for alignment. 

How common or frequent is this problem? 
This is a common issue that requires multiple team members to review documents against multiple Standards of Practice and document the discrepancies for the vendor in order to resolve. These manual reviewing processes have impacted our department productivity.

What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting? I see that every Statement of Work within our company (completed 4 times/year) requires in excess of 60 hours of work/reviewer to complete the reviews and document compliance or discrepancies. This could be done by an AI solution to provide the comparison of Standards against various documents and identify discrepances/compliance and note in a document for a final review for approval by the organization. We could potentially expand our department's ability to review more documents 

Challenges
Privacy and Security will need to be involved in this project from the beginning of design. It will be necessary to pay attention to data integrity and it will be necessary to be very careful to ensure that the data is confidential and that the data that is being reviewed is not stored. A final review of the Statement of Work documentation will still need to be completed to determine approval of the Statement of Work.
